- Hypar.Revit is completely rewritten as an external application, two external commands, and an IDirectContext3D server.

### Changed

- some Tessellate method signatures are updated to allow assigning colors at the time of tessellation as Revit requires vertex colors.
- Updates are made to the type generator to support compiling multiple types into an assembly on disk.

## 0.7.2

### Fixed

- [#307](https://github.com/hypar-io/Elements/issues/307)
- `Mesh.ComputeNormals()` would fail if there were any unconnected vertices.
- `new Vertex()` would ignore supplied Normals.
- `Vector3.ClosestPointOn(Line)` would return points that were not on the line.

- `Line.Trim(Polygon)`
- `Line.PointOnLine(Vector3 point)`
- **Grid1d**
  - `Grid1d(Grid1d other)` constructor
  - Adds `IgnoreOutsideDomain` flag to `SplitAtOffset`
  - Adds `SplitAtPoint(point)` and `SplitAtPoints(points)` methods
  - Adds internal `Evaluate(t)` method
  - Adds internal `SpawnSubGrid(domain)` method
- **Grid2d**
  - Adds `Grid2d(Grid2d other)` constructor

### Changed

- Updates to Elements Docs including Grasshopper + Excel.
- `Line.Intersects(Plane p)` supports infinite lines
- `Line.Intersects(Line l)` supports 3d line intersections
- `Line.Intersects(Line l)` now has an optional flag indicating whether to include the line ends as intersections.
- `Line.PointOnLine(Point)` now has an optional flag indicating whether to include points at the ends as "on" the line.
- **Grid1d / Grid2d**
  - Removes "Parent/child" updating from 1d grids / 2d grids in favor of always recalculating the 2d grid every time its `Cells` are accessed. This may have a bit of a performance hit, but it's worth it to make 2d grid behavior easier to reason about.
  - Allows Grid2ds to support construction from Grid1ds that are not straight lines. Previously Grid1ds could support any sort of curve and Grid2ds were stuck as dumb rectangles.
- **JsonInheritanceConverter**
  - Makes the Type Cache on the JsonInheritanceConverter static, and exposes a public method to refresh it. In the grasshopper context, new types may have been dynamically loaded since the JsonInheritanceConverter was initialized, so it needs to be refreshed before deserializing a model.
- **TypeGenerator**
  - Enables external overriding of the Templates path, as in GH's case the `Templates` folder is not in the same place as the executing assembly.
  - Exposes a public, synchronous method `GetSchema` to get a `JsonSchema` from uri (wrapping `GetSchemaAsync`)
  - Refactors some of the internal processes of `GenerateInMemoryAssemblyFromUrisAndLoadAsync`:
    - `GenerateCodeFromSchema()` produces csharp from a schema, including generating the namespace, typename, and local excludes
    - `GenerateCompilation()` takes the csharp and compiles it, using a new optional flag `frameworkBuild` to designate whether it should load netstandard or net framework reference assemblies.
    - `EmitAndLoad()` generates the assembly in memory and loads it into the app domain.
  - Adds an `EmitAndSave()` method that generates the assembly and writes it to a .dll on disk
  - Adds a public `GenerateAndSaveDllForSchema()` method used by grasshopper that generates code from a schema, generates a compilation, and saves it to disk as a DLL.
  - Adds a public `GetLoadedElementTypes()` method used by grasshopper to list all the currently loaded element types.

### Deprecated

- `Transform.OfXXX(xxx)` curve methods have been deprecated in favor of `XXX.Transformed(Transform)` and `XXX.TransformedXXX(Transform)`.

- `Matrix.Inverse()`
- `Transform.Invert()`
- `Model.ToIFC()`
- `Elements.Serialization.JSON` namespace.
- `Elements.Serialization.IFC` namespace.
- `Elements.Serialization.glTF` namespace.

### Changed

- Wall constructor which uses a center line can now have a Transform specified.
- `Profile.ComputeTransform()` now finds the first 3 non-collinear points for calculating its plane. Previously, this function would break when two of the first three vertices were co-linear.
- Using Hypar.IFC2X3 for interaction with IFC.
- `Line.Thicken()` now throws an exception when the line does not have the same elevation for both end points.
- `Model.SaveGlb()` is now `Model.ToGlTF()`.

## 0.2.1

### Added

- The `Topography` class has been added.
- `Transform.OfPoint(Vector3 vector)` has been added to transform a vector as a point with translation. This was previously `Transform.OfVector(Vector3 vector)`. All sites previously using `OfVector(...)` are now using `OfPoint(...)`.
- `Material.DoubleSided`
- `Loop.InsertEdgeAfter()`
- `Solid.Slice()`
- `Model.Extensions`

### Changed

- `Transform.OfVector(Vector3 vector)` now does proper vector transformation without translation.
- Attempting to construct a `Vector3` with NaN or Infinite arguments will throw an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- IFC implementation has begun with `Model.FromIFC(...)`. Support includes reading of Walls, Slabs, Spaces, Beams, and Columns. Brep booleans required for Wall and Slab openings are not yet supported and are instead converted to Polygon openings in Wall and Floor profiles.
- The `Elements.Geometry.Profiles` namespace has been added. All profile servers can now be found here.
- The `Elements.Geometry.Solids` namespace has been added.
- The Frame type has been added to represent a continuous extrusion of a profile around a polygonal perimeter.
- The `ModelTest` base class has been added. Inheriting from this test class enables a test to automatically write its `Model` to a `.glb` file and to serialize and deserialize to/from JSON to ensure the stability of serialization.
- The `Solid.ToGlb` extension method has been added to enable serializing one `Solid` to glTF for testing.

### Changed

- Element identifiers are now of type `long`.
- Breps have been re-implemented in the `Solid` class. Currently only planar trimmed faces are supported.
- Many improvements to JSON serialization have been added, including the ability to serialize breps.
- '{element}.AddParameter' has been renamed to '{element}.AddProperty'.
- The `Hypar.Geometry` namespace is now `Elements.Geometry`.
- The `Hypar.Elements` namespace is now `Elements`.

### Removed

- The `IProfile` interface has been removed.
- The `Extrusion` class and `IBrep` have been replaced with the `Solid` class. The IGeometry interface now returns a `Solid[]`.
- Many uses of `System.Linq` have been removed.
- Many uses of `IEnumerable<T>` have been replaced with `T[]`.

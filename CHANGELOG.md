- Updates are made to the type generator to support compiling multiple types into an assembly on disk.

## 0.7.2

### Fixed

- [#307](https://github.com/hypar-io/Elements/issues/307)

- `Line.Intersects(Line l)` supports 3d line intersections
- `Line.Intersects(Line l)` now has an optional flag indicating whether to include the line ends as intersections.
- `Line.PointOnLine(Point)` now has an optional flag indicating whether to include points at the ends as "on" the line.
- **Grid1d / Grid2d**
  - Removes "Parent/child" updating from 1d grids / 2d grids in favor of always recalculating the 2d grid every time its `Cells` are accessed. This may have a bit of a performance hit, but it's worth it to make 2d grid behavior easier to reason about.
  - Allows Grid2ds to support construction from Grid1ds that are not straight lines. Previously Grid1ds could support any sort of curve and Grid2ds were stuck as dumb rectangles.
- **JsonInheritanceConverter**
  - Makes the Type Cache on the JsonInheritanceConverter static, and exposes a public method to refresh it. In the grasshopper context, new types may have been dynamically loaded since the JsonInheritanceConverter was initialized, so it needs to be refreshed before deserializing a model.
- **TypeGenerator**
  - Enables external overriding of the Templates path, as in GH's case the `Templates` folder is not in the same place as the executing assembly.
  - Exposes a public, synchronous method `GetSchema` to get a `JsonSchema` from uri (wrapping `GetSchemaAsync`)
  - Refactors some of the internal processes of `GenerateInMemoryAssemblyFromUrisAndLoadAsync`:
    - `GenerateCodeFromSchema()` produces csharp from a schema, including generating the namespace, typename, and local excludes
    - `GenerateCompilation()` takes the csharp and compiles it, using a new optional flag `frameworkBuild` to designate whether it should load netstandard or net framework reference assemblies.
    - `EmitAndLoad()` generates the assembly in memory and loads it into the app domain.
  - Adds an `EmitAndSave()` method that generates the assembly and writes it to a .dll on disk
  - Adds a public `GenerateAndSaveDllForSchema()` method used by grasshopper that generates code from a schema, generates a compilation, and saves it to disk as a DLL.
  - Adds a public `GetLoadedElementTypes()` method used by grasshopper to list all the currently loaded element types.

### Deprecated

- `Transform.OfXXX(xxx)` curve methods have been deprecated in favor of `XXX.Transformed(Transform)` and `XXX.TransformedXXX(Transform)`.

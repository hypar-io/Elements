# 2.0

Elements 2.0 is a big step for `Curve` geometry in Elements.

We have changed the internal parameterization of curves to allow for more flexibility in the future and to adhere to common industry standards. This change is not backwards compatible, and will require some changes to your code.

We have also added a new `BoundedCurve` class that is the base class for curves that have a fixed domain.

For more details see the [Elements 2.0 Release](https://github.com/hypar-io/Elements/blob/master/releases/elements_2.0.md) page for more details.
